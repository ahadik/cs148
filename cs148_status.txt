 Assignment 1: CHECK 
 code works properly, but need to create branches for individual assignments for completion checks
 a check can be granted once proper branch is in place 
 nice redesign of output messaging; jitter toggle worked nicely 
 github will translate 'Assignment 1' into 'Assignment-1'. Please use 'Assignment-X' for branching of Assignment X
 branch lables are case sensitive
 comment: branch now found properly 
 Assignment 2: UNCHECKED
 error: incorrect output on all test cases
 comment: the output transforms look to be incorrect, through the kinematics seem to be traversed
